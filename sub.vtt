It's TED Talks Daily.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.920
I'm Elise Hugh.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.560
Prosthetics have advanced so much in recent years, but for amputees around the world,

00:12.560 --> 00:15.960
they're still often way too expensive.

00:15.960 --> 00:21.940
In his talk from TED 2022, bionic innovator Enzo Romero shares how he's found unconventional

00:21.940 --> 00:26.940
solutions to get more advanced prosthetics to the people who need them.

00:26.940 --> 00:30.600
He makes them more affordable and functional.

00:30.600 --> 00:36.000
Have you ever wondered what makes great minds tick?

00:36.000 --> 00:40.820
I'm Adam Grant, and on my new podcast, Rethinking, I'm trying to find the answers.

00:40.820 --> 00:44.220
Every week, I interview some of my favorite thinkers to learn how we can bring out the

00:44.220 --> 00:46.120
best in ourselves and others.

00:46.120 --> 00:52.400
I talk to death-defying rock climbers, Oscar-winning filmmakers, creators like Lin-Manuel Miranda,

00:52.400 --> 00:56.200
entrepreneurs like Mark Cuban, and thought leaders like Brene Brown.

00:56.200 --> 01:03.520
Find Rethinking on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you listen.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.000
Support for TED Talks Daily comes from Zelle.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.940
When anyone sends you money or if you need to get paid back, always ask for Zelle.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.540
With Zelle, the money goes straight into your bank account, and it works even if the sender

01:14.540 --> 01:17.800
bank is somewhere different than you in the US.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.760
It's really useful whether it's asking other parents from school to split the cost

01:22.760 --> 01:27.260
of pizza or asking friends to chip in for a group gift for someone else.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.880
The money goes straight into your bank account, typically in minutes between enrolled users,

01:30.880 --> 01:33.600
and those of y'all who use Zelle probably know that already.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.400
It's in more than 1,600 banking apps, so you can look for Zelle in your banking app

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
today.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.340
One in seven people around the world has some kind of disability.

01:44.340 --> 01:49.120
Being born without my right hand has defined who I am over the past 30 years.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.640
I was fortunate to grow in the sacred valley of the Incas in Cusco, Peru, surrounded by

01:53.640 --> 01:58.820
people who weren't surprised to see me driving my bike or probably playing basketball.

01:58.820 --> 02:03.500
When I was seven, I remember being stunned after I watched Star Wars, The Empire Strikes

02:03.500 --> 02:08.960
Back, when Luke's hand gets cut off, the same one I didn't have, but then being twice

02:08.960 --> 02:15.680
a stun when the medical robots fitted him with a prosthesis that could move and feel.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.240
From then on, no greater purpose lived in my mind, which was to have a prosthesis like

02:20.240 --> 02:22.760
Luke Skywalker.

02:22.760 --> 02:27.520
This dream led me to study mechatronics engineering and access the biomechanics and applied robotics

02:27.520 --> 02:33.240
laboratory in Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, where, with a multidisciplinary team,

02:33.240 --> 02:37.560
we developed a myoelectric prosthesis for long-term radial amputation, being me the

02:37.560 --> 02:39.160
pilot user.

02:39.160 --> 02:44.080
I was able to move each finger individually, and also we developed a way in which we get

02:44.080 --> 02:49.400
to pass the sensation from the fingertips into my forearm using haptic feedback system.

02:49.400 --> 02:54.680
Since this was a research project, we had enough funding to buy stuff from abroad.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.680
So for example, the motors here were all brought by Switzerland.

02:58.680 --> 03:05.960
This is one of the main reasons why it will cost at least $40,000 to make this prosthesis.

03:05.960 --> 03:11.600
But 40k is way too much, considering that four out of five people with upper limb amputation

03:11.600 --> 03:13.960
live in development countries.

03:13.960 --> 03:19.640
And the $25,000 that costs a robotic prosthesis imported from abroad is way too much.

03:19.640 --> 03:24.920
In Peru, that is equivalent to work full-time on a minimum wage for almost seven years,

03:24.920 --> 03:28.760
just to buy the prosthesis, never mind pay for your food or your house.

03:28.760 --> 03:34.120
It is often that people get injured while doing manual labor activities, like farming

03:34.120 --> 03:36.760
or metal manufacturing.

03:36.760 --> 03:42.960
Getting back to work and having access to money demands a functional hand.

03:42.960 --> 03:48.040
It took me time to realize what a huge privilege I had to study a career that would help fulfill

03:48.040 --> 03:49.040
my dreams.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.920
But actually, what was preventing me from developing a solution that was both affordable

03:54.920 --> 03:56.420
and functional?

03:56.420 --> 04:01.080
The very first step in order to reduce the cost was to reduce the number of motors, because

04:01.080 --> 04:04.200
they were all imported and therefore expensive.

04:04.200 --> 04:10.960
So we get to arrange occupational focus groups with our amputee volunteers in order to identify

04:10.960 --> 04:14.960
which gestures they will use the most and of those, how many we could perform using

04:14.960 --> 04:16.840
just a single motor.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.960
The answer was three.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.720
Pinch, cylindrical, and lateral.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.400
This also helps us to reduce the number of electromyographic sensors too.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.480
From an arrangement of eight, we pass just to one.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.760
In this way, between makes in your mechanical and my electric prosthesis, the prices will

04:35.760 --> 04:37.960
be dramatically low.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.720
But material prices matter too.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.480
And that's why we choose to 3D print our prosthesis using mainly plastic from recycled

04:45.480 --> 04:46.480
bottles.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.240
In order to develop our prosthesis, the process will go like this.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.240
First, we'll use our 3D scan and our own parameterization software in order to take the measures of

04:55.240 --> 04:58.520
the amputated area and the other hand of the user.

04:58.520 --> 05:03.120
Then we'll recreate the entire set of fingers, the palm, and the prosthesis socket in our

05:03.120 --> 05:07.900
computational model to finally 3D print each of those parts.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.480
So far, in lab bionics, we have two types of prosthesis.

05:11.480 --> 05:15.960
Mach-E, which is a mechanical activation, and Pisco with electronic activation.

05:15.960 --> 05:21.860
Pisco costs just 10% of an imported robotic prosthesis that will come from abroad.

05:21.860 --> 05:26.960
This means that even more working class people can access to our technology.

05:26.960 --> 05:33.760
For me, this has been a path where I was able to develop this in my company, lab bionics.

05:33.760 --> 05:39.280
So for example, take Franco, which now is using his transradial Mach-E prosthesis in

05:39.280 --> 05:44.360
order to get back to work with his providers on the jungle farm he has.

05:44.360 --> 05:49.320
I am certain that we are able to be on the side with technology that is brought from

05:49.320 --> 05:53.440
abroad to our region, being sold in a very expensive way.

05:53.440 --> 05:59.440
We have the capacity to develop our own technology, having the necessities of our people in mind.

05:59.440 --> 06:05.440
So then people with disabilities and limited resources could live a life again.

06:05.440 --> 06:12.640
For me, when people, our users, get back to work on their places, that look of compassion

06:12.640 --> 06:14.720
changed to astonishment.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.740
The same astonishment which I had when I saw Luke Skywalker's prosthesis.

06:19.740 --> 06:25.140
So this began as a path for myself, but it now belongs to my entire region.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.400
Would you like to join us?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
Thank you so much.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.400
Thank you.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
Thank you.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
Thank you.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
Thank you.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.640
Ted Talks Daily is hosted by me, Elise Huw, and produced by TED.

We record the talks at TED events we host, or from TEDx events, which are organized independently

06:45.080 --> 06:47.760
by volunteers all over the world.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.280
And we'd love to hear from you.
