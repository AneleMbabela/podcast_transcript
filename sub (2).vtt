00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
You're listening to TED Talks Daily, I'm Elise Hugh.

00:07.480 --> 00:12.840
Creativity is both awesome to see and kind of mysterious in how it comes about, but could

00:12.840 --> 00:15.400
it be more easily cultivated?

00:15.400 --> 00:20.680
In his archive talk from TED 2020, the actor, writer, and director Ethan Hawke offers his

00:20.680 --> 00:26.720
ideas on the magic of creativity and how to make it come alive in ourselves and others.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.240
What's coming up?

00:30.240 --> 00:34.440
I was hoping today to talk a little bit about creativity.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.800
You know, a lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
And reasonably so.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.880
I mean, we're all a little suspect of our own talent.

00:42.880 --> 00:48.920
And I remember a story I came across in my early 20s that kind of meant a lot to me.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.800
I was really into Alan Ginsberg and I was reading his poetry and I was reading, he did

00:52.800 --> 00:54.120
a lot of interviews.

00:54.120 --> 01:00.920
And one time William F. Buckley had this television program called Firing Line.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.480
And Ginsberg went on there and sang a Hare Krishna song playing the harmonium.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.280
You know, and he got back to New York to all his intelligentsia friends and they all told

01:10.280 --> 01:11.800
him, did you know that everybody thinks you're an idiot?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.320
I mean, the whole country is making fun of you.

01:14.320 --> 01:19.720
And he said, that's my job.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.520
You know, I'm a poet and I'm going to play the fool.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.000
Most people have to go to work all day long and they come home and they fight with their

01:26.000 --> 01:29.680
spouse and they eat and they like turn on the old boob tube and somebody tries to sell

01:29.680 --> 01:31.280
them something.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.880
And I just screwed all that up.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.080
I went on and I sang about Krishna and now they're sitting in bed and going, who's this

01:38.080 --> 01:39.080
stupid poet?

01:39.080 --> 01:40.800
And they can't fall asleep, right?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.120
And that's his job as a poet.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.480
And so I find that very liberating because I think that most of us really want to offer

01:48.480 --> 01:54.480
the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important.

01:54.480 --> 02:02.040
And that's really the enemy because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.920
And if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic, right?

02:07.920 --> 02:14.760
So you have to ask yourself, do you think human creativity matters?

02:14.760 --> 02:21.920
Well, most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about poetry, right?

02:21.920 --> 02:26.040
They have a life to live and they're not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg's poems

02:26.040 --> 02:30.240
or anybody's poems until their father dies.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.720
They go to a funeral, you lose a child.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.000
Somebody breaks your heart, they don't love you anymore.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.240
And all of a sudden you're desperate for making sense out of this life.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.740
And has anybody ever felt this bad before?

02:44.740 --> 02:46.000
How did they come out of this cloud?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.320
Or the inverse, something great.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.240
You meet somebody and your heart explodes.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.120
You love them so much you can't even see straight.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.120
You know, you're dizzy.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.560
Did anybody feel like this before?

02:55.560 --> 02:57.200
What is happening to me?

02:57.200 --> 03:02.000
And that's when art's not a luxury, it's actually sustenance.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
We need it.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.560
OK, well, what is it?

03:05.560 --> 03:10.560
Human creativity is nature manifest in us.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.920
We look at the, oh, the Aurora Borealis, right?

03:15.920 --> 03:19.280
I did this movie called White Fang when I was a kid and we shot up in Alaska.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.720
And you go out at night and the sky was like rippling with purple and pink and white.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.480
And it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.600
It really looked like the sky was playing.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Beautiful.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.100
Go to Grand Canyon at sundown.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.100
It's beautiful.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.640
We know that's beautiful.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.000
But fall in love, your lover's pretty beautiful.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.760
I have four kids watching them play, watching them like pretend to be a butterfly or run

03:42.760 --> 03:45.560
around the house or doing anything.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.320
It's so beautiful.

03:47.320 --> 03:53.480
And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
Right.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.560
And first we have to survive and then we have to thrive and to thrive to express ourselves.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
All right.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
Well, here's the rub.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.160
We have to know ourselves.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.000
What do you love?

04:06.000 --> 04:11.680
And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you and it expands.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.200
For me, it was really easy.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.920
I did my first professional play as 12 years old.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.400
I was in a play called St. Joan by George Bernard Shaw at the McCarter Theater.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.920
And boom, I was in love.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.400
My world just expanded.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.160
And that profession, I'm almost 50 now, that profession has never stopped giving back to

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
me.

04:31.160 --> 04:36.760
And I've learned more and more, mostly strangely through the characters that I've played.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.560
I've played cops.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.840
I've played criminals.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.160
I've played priests.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.680
I've played sinners.

04:42.680 --> 04:48.040
And the magic of this over a lifetime, over 30 years of doing this, is that you start

04:48.040 --> 04:54.720
to see that my experiences, me, Ethan, is not nearly as unique as I thought.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.920
I have so much in common with all these people.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.480
And so they have something in common with me.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.560
You start to see how connected we all are.

05:05.560 --> 05:12.160
My grandmother, my great grandmother, Della Hall Walker Green, on her deathbed, she wrote

05:12.160 --> 05:14.520
this little biography in the hospital.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.700
And it was only about 36 pages long.

05:17.700 --> 05:24.220
And she spent about five pages on the one time she did costumes for a play.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.560
Her first husband got like a paragraph, right?

05:27.560 --> 05:32.760
One farming, of which she did for 50 years, gets a mention.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.440
Five pages on doing these costumes.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.680
And I look, my mom gave me one of her quilts that she made.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.960
And you can feel it.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.400
She was expressing herself.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.920
And it has a power that's real.

05:43.920 --> 05:49.440
I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see Top Gun whatever year that came out.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.280
And I remember we walked out of the mall, it was like blazing hot.

05:52.280 --> 05:59.840
I just looked at him and we both felt that movie just like a calling from God.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.840
But completely differently.

06:00.840 --> 06:01.840
Like I wanted to be an actor.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.600
I was like, I got to make something that makes people feel.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.080
I just want to be a part of that.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.280
And he wanted to be in the military.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.600
That's what all we ever did is play FBI, play Army man, play Knights.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.720
And I'd like pose with my sword.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.080
And he would build a working crossbow.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.920
He could shoot an arrow into a tree.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.440
So he joins the Army.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.680
Well he just retired.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.720
Colonel in the Green Berets.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.640
He's a multi-decorated combat veteran of Afghanistan in Iraq.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.200
He now teaches a sail camp for children of fallen soldiers.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.920
He gave his life to his passion.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.680
His creativity was leadership.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.080
Leading others, his bravery to help others.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.520
That was something he felt called to do.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.620
And it gave back to him.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.620
We know this.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.240
The time of our life is so short.

06:43.240 --> 06:48.040
And how we spend it, are we spending it doing what's important to us?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
Most of us not.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.800
I mean, it's hard.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.520
The pull of habit is so huge.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.120
And that's what makes kids so beautifully creative.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.120
Is that they don't have any habits.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.160
And they don't care if they're any good or not.

07:00.160 --> 07:05.760
They're not building a sandcastle going, I think I'm going to be a really good sandcastle

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
builder.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.320
They throw themselves at whatever project you put in front of them.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.500
Dancing, doing a painting, building something.

07:13.500 --> 07:20.160
Any opportunity they have, they try to use it to impress upon you their individuality.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.080
It's so beautiful.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.280
Is a thing that worries me sometimes whenever you talk about creativity.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.680
Because it can have this kind of feel that it's just nice.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.220
You know, or it's warm, or it's something pleasant.

07:32.220 --> 07:33.220
It's not.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.760
It's vital.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.520
It's the way we heal each other.

07:37.520 --> 07:43.880
In singing our song, in telling our story, in inviting you to say, hey, listen to me

07:43.880 --> 07:45.400
and I'll listen to you.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.440
We're starting a dialogue.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.640
You know, and when you do that, this healing happens.

07:50.640 --> 07:55.440
And we come out of our corners and we start to witness each other's common humanity.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.680
We start to assert it.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.360
And when we do that, really good things happen.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.800
So if you want to help your community, if you want to help your family, if you want

08:03.800 --> 08:07.080
to help your friends, you have to express yourself.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.560
And to express yourself, you have to know yourself.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.920
It's actually super easy.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.240
Just have to follow your love.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.040
There is no path.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.600
There's no path till you walk it.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.280
And you have to be willing to play the fool.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.620
So don't read the book that you should read.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.460
Read the book you want to read.

08:28.460 --> 08:31.880
Don't listen to the music that you used to like.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.140
Take some time to listen to some new music.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.400
Take some time to talk to somebody that you don't normally talk to.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.000
I guarantee if you do that, you will feel foolish.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.560
That's the point.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
Play the fool.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.800
